    <h1>Art</h1>
    <p>I don't like everything from the following artists, but I do look out for their names</p>
    <p>Many are members of Sherborne Contemporary Arts (SCA), and exhibited at Sherborne House</p>
    <p>Below the Artists are some Galleries and Arts Weeks that I visit. Bold links indicate what I find consistently interesting, rather than (necessarily) what I like best</p>
    <p>[Finally, some US museums/ galleries I enjoyed]</p>
    <p>Local arts magazine is &quot;<a href="http://www.evolver.org.uk">Evolver</a>&quot; (&quot;Promoting the arts in Wessex&quot;), available free from various shops and galleries, or £15 for 6 issues [<a href="mailto:simon@evolver.org.uk">email</a>]</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.angelacharles.com/"><strong>Angela Charles</strong></a> : Exhibited at <a href="http://www.sherbornehouse.org.uk/openhouse/pages/angela_charles.html">Sherborne House</a>, Alpha House Gallery and Blue Lias. Met in Dec-03 at Sherborne House</p>
    <p>Susan Caines : Liked her Italian landscapes, particularly &quot;Sienese Landscape I&quot; seen at Alpha House Gallery in Nov-02. Oil on linen gives them a dreamy quality, like a heat haze</p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.rchittenden.co.uk/">Rosanna Chittenden</a></strong> : Was keen to buy a <a href="http://www.rchittenden.co.uk/lwc.html">figure</a> Diptych that I saw at exhibition (Sherborne House Jun-01), but it was already sold. (Not on her site, for me to link to, but the images there are similar)</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.marziacolonna.com/"><strong>Marzia Colonna</strong></a> : Bronze sculpture of the human form, and drawings. First saw her work at an Alpha House Gallery exhibition in Jun-02, and met during Dorset Art Weeks (Jun-04). Own one drawing</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.clandonart.com/">Vicky Finding</a> : Bought one of the Sea studies ("Squall 2" ...called "Sea 1" on website, I think) in Oct-01, from William Pelly Gallery, and still very happy with it. Met during Dorset Art Weeks (Jun-04)</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.van-rijn.co.uk/"><strong>Alan Hussey</strong></a> : &quot;Beautiful contemporary minimalist furniture in solid English hardwoods.&quot; I agree with this. Saw Alan's workshop during Dorset Art Weeks (Jun-02). Exhibits at Dansel Gallery</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.island-gallery.co.uk/art/abstract/heidi_konig/">Heidi Konig</a> : Seen at Rostra Gallery in Aug-03</p>
    <p><a href="http://fineart.ac.uk/artists/130/">Ian Potts</a> : Liked "'The edge of the blue' : Feluccas on the Nile" that I saw at Alpha House (Mar-02)</p>
    <p>Rachel Sargent :</p>
    <p><strong>Jennifer Semmons</strong> : Alpha House Gallery Feb-03. I liked a few (&quot;City Sunset&quot;, &quot;Venetian Triptych&quot;, &quot;Vestibule&quot;), but can't find any images</p>
    <p><strong>Amanda Wallwork</strong> : Some wonderful colours and shapes. Always come away from her exhibitions with new thoughts, and have several pieces at home. The artist who (Jun-00) first inspired me to buy, and to keep visiting galleries</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.blackandwhiteimages.co.uk/"><strong>Joy White</strong></a> :
    Hand-printed B&amp;W photographs. Met and bought several in Dec-03. Exhibits at Blue Lias gallery</p>
